# Immersive long-form TTS architecture

## Goal

StudyPod should create a complete, resumable audiobook from a long PDF or ebook without flattening the book into one giant request, changing narrator voices between chapters, or producing an unmanageably large WAV file.

The pipeline now separates three concerns:

1. **Book understanding** — preserve metadata, front matter, chapter/part boundaries, page ranges, and narration-specific text.
2. **Narration** — clean PDF line wrapping, split at sentence/paragraph boundaries, keep one narrator, cache every section, and expose progress.
3. **Delivery** — join section audio with natural pauses and encode a compact MP3, M4B, or lossless WAV.

## Provider strategy

### Kokoro local — default

Use Kokoro for the default zero-cost local path.

- Lightweight enough for CPU use.
- Fast startup after the first model load.
- Predictable and suitable for chapter previews or complete books.
- StudyPod defaults to the `af_heart` voice through the `immersive_narrator` alias.
- The `immersive` profile keeps one voice for the whole book, uses shorter sentence-aware chunks, and adds paragraph/chapter pauses.

Kokoro remains slightly synthetic on long emotional passages. It is the practical default, not the quality ceiling.

### Chatterbox expressive — optional high-quality path

StudyPod includes an optional local Chatterbox bridge:

- Node integration: `AUDIOBOOK_CHATTERBOX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4123`
- Bridge: `backend/python/chatterbox_server.py`
- Requirements: `backend/python/requirements-chatterbox.txt`
- Optional reference voice: `CHATTERBOX_REFERENCE_AUDIO=C:\path\to\clean-reference.wav`

Chatterbox is the preferred experimental quality tier because its repository is MIT licensed, supports expressive controls, and can condition on a clean reference clip. The bridge is intentionally separate from the Node process because PyTorch/model dependencies are large and should not inflate the main backend or Vercel bundle.

A 10–20 second clean, single-speaker reference clip is preferable. Only use voices the user owns or has permission to clone.

### Engines evaluated but not selected as defaults

- **F5-TTS:** strong quality and long-form/community tooling, but the official pretrained weights are non-commercial even though the code is MIT. Keep it out of the default product path unless licensing changes or the user supplies compatible weights.
- **Fish Speech S2:** excellent research direction, but the official deployment guidance calls for substantially more VRAM than the current target machine. Not a practical local default.
- **XTTS-v2:** useful multilingual voice cloning and streaming, but its model license is more restrictive than a straightforward permissive product dependency.

## Chatterbox setup

Use Python 3.11 in a dedicated environment:

```powershell
cd backend
py -3.11 -m venv .venv-chatterbox
.\.venv-chatterbox\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r python\requirements-chatterbox.txt
$env:CHATTERBOX_DEVICE = "auto"
# Optional, only for a clean reference voice you own or may use:
# $env:CHATTERBOX_REFERENCE_AUDIO = "C:\path\to\reference.wav"
python python\chatterbox_server.py
```

In the StudyPod backend terminal:

```powershell
$env:AUDIOBOOK_CHATTERBOX_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4123"
node backend\src\server.js
```

The Audiobook Studio voice-engine selector enables **Chatterbox expressive** only when the bridge URL is configured.

## Long-form quality rules

- Preserve one narrator unless the user deliberately selects a multi-voice production.
- Never split in the middle of a word.
- Prefer paragraph and sentence boundaries; fall back to clauses, then words.
- Remove PDF soft hyphens and reconstruct wrapped lines before synthesis.
- Speak a short opening credit instead of narrating ISBN/catalog/legal boilerplate by default.
- Cache each section independently so an interrupted six-hour book resumes instead of restarting.
- Persist job state to disk so progress survives a backend restart.
- Encode final output as MP3 or M4B; reserve WAV for editing or archival use.
- Keep 0.9–1.2 seconds between chapters and a much shorter pause between synthesis chunks.

## Synchronization roadmap

StudyPod now has a deterministic listening-context handoff from audiobook playback into grounded notebook chat. **Ask about this point** pauses playback and carries the audiobook source ID, chapter title, current timestamp, page range, and listener question into chat. Until sentence-level timing exists, the system deliberately grounds to chapter/page context instead of claiming that a playback timestamp identifies an exact sentence. On mobile, the request is queued while the interface switches from Studio back to Chat.

A probabilistic reranker such as Jev should only be evaluated after sentence candidates exist, and only in shadow mode for genuinely ambiguous bindings. Chapter IDs, page ranges, timestamps, source ownership, playback state, and fallback grounding remain deterministic.

The next quality layer should follow a Calliope-style approach:

1. Preserve exact text-to-audio timing returned by the TTS engine when available.
2. Produce chapter-level and sentence-level timing manifests.
3. Package EPUB3 media overlays for ebooks.
4. Highlight the currently narrated sentence in StudyPod.
5. Add pronunciation overrides and a review queue for names, acronyms, formulas, and citations.

Forced alignment should be a fallback, not the primary timing source, because alignment drift compounds across long books.

## Real-book validation

Book under test: `The AI-Driven Leader` by Geoff Woods.

- 398 PDF pages
- 23 audiobook sections
- 14 numbered chapters plus parts, conclusion, resources, appendix, acknowledgments, author biography, and shortened opening credits
- 62,798 narration words
- About 6 hours 45 minutes at 155 words per minute before profile speed adjustment
- Beginning, middle, late-book, appendix, and conclusion chat checks passed with structured grounding
- Full 23-section mock audiobook assembled and encoded to a single MP3
- Real Kokoro samples generated for Heart and Bella
