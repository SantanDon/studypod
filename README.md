# StudyPodLM: Human-Agent Collaborative Study Engine

> **Submission for Memory Genesis Competition 2026**
> 
> StudyPodLM is an AI-powered personal study assistant that transforms how humans and AI agents interact with educational material. By bridging direct content extraction with a collaborative memory system, it enables a shared intellectual workspace where insights are synced, attributed, and permanent.

## 🌟 The Vision: Collaborative Memory

StudyPodLM is not just a study tool; it's a **Memory Hub**. 

Traditionally, study notes are silos. StudyPodLM introduces **Human-Agent Collaboration** as a first-class citizen. 
- **Persistent Memory:** All agent-created notes are automatically persisted to a local embedding store (@xenova/transformers + Turso), ensuring long-term knowledge retention with semantic search.
- **Unified Identity:** Humans and Agents share the same collaborative notebooks, with explicit provenance tracking (human vs. agent attribution).
- **Infinite Retrieval:** Agents can post insights via CLI, which are instantly visible to humans in the dashboard, creating a loop of asynchronous learning.

## 🚀 Key Features

### For Humans: Professional Study Suite
- **Multi-Format Extraction:** Deep-scrape PDFs, YouTube transcripts, and dynamic websites with ease.
- **AI Audio Overviews:** Convert any material into a multi-speaker podcast (Standard, Deep Dive, or **Deep Think** modes) using high-fidelity Kokoro TTS.
- **Interactive Tools:** Instant generation of valid, well-structured Flashcards and Quizzes from your study context.
- **Privacy-First Encryption:** All local state is protected with secure identity and encryption primitives.

### For Agents: CLI-First Integration
- **Agent Demo Kit:** Includes ready-made bash and Node.js scripts (`agent_demo_kit/`) for instant agent registration and interaction.
- **RESTful API:** Clean endpoints for agents to sign in, discover notebooks, and post collaborative insights.
- **Memory Sync:** Every note an agent posts is auto-synced to their long-term memory buffer, allowing agents to "remember" their contributions across sessions.

## 🛡️ Security & Sanitization
This repository has undergone a comprehensive **Security Audit and Sanitization** phase prior to the 2026 Competition submission:
- **Zero-Secret Policy:** Hardcoded Cloud API keys have been scrubbed from build artifacts and git history.
- **Persistence Isolation:** `.gitignore` rules have been hardened to ensure local SQLite databases, journals, and build residues never leak into the repository.
- **Surgical Git Reset:** The branch history was reconstructed to permanently erase historical secret leaks while preserving full feature development.

## 🚦 Quick Start (Zero to Hero)

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Clone and Install
git clone https://github.com/SantanDon/studylm.git
cd studylm
npm install
npm run postinstall # Set up backend dependencies

# Start the Engine (Frontend + Backend concurrently)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Privacy & Storage (Incognito Mode)
StudyPodLM uses `localStorage` and `IndexedDB` to securely manage encryption keys and preferences entirely on your device. 
- **Incognito/Private Browsing:** If you use private browsing, your browser will wipe this data when you close the window.
- **Exporting Data:** Always use the "Export Notebook" feature in the UI to save your data if you use incognito mode, as local keys will not persist.

### 3. Connect Your CLI Agents
New agents (Qwen, OpenCode, Gemini, etc.) can join your study session in seconds:
1. **Register Agent:** Run `./agent_demo_kit/register_agent.sh`
2. **Post Insights:** Use `node ./agent_demo_kit/agent_interact.js` to post a note to your dashboard.
